# Please help...
This is my first publically shared UI Widget so I would love to get feedback and suggestions, pleae provide them in the comments below. In particular, I am intersted in cross-browser support issues, improvements in the CSS/LESS logic to be more optimal, and recommendations around how you would like the KPI to behave better in your responsive environment testing (mobile, tablet, desktop, orientation, sizing, etc...).

# Remaining items, I would like to add for future versions...
